On a lonely island out there in the middle of the pacific, two fertile rabbits are marooned in order to determine how many rabbits will be born per year. Thereby we assume that every two grown-up rabbits breeds a fresh pair of rabbits every month.
Every pair of rabbits is already fertile within the first month of their lives, and each rabbit has a life-time of 3 month. Write a MiniJava program which reads in the number n denoting the n-th month. You may assume that n>=1. Your program then should determine the number of all pairs of rabbits which are fertile in the n-th month. As examples may serve the following table:

Month	1.Generation	2.Generation	3.Generation
1	1		
2	1	1	
3	2	1	1
4	4	2	1
5	7	4	2

Hint: Use the method readInt() from MiniJava to input numbers.

Examples:
 1 1 of 1 tests passing
<Please insert a number:
>1
<1
 2 1 of 1 tests passing
<Please insert a number:
>2
<2
 3 1 of 1 tests passing
<Please insert a number:
>3
<4
 4 1 of 1 tests passing
<Please insert a number:
>4
<7
 Input values up to 36 1 of 1 tests passing
Hint: For better readability in examples, lines output by the program are preceded with "<" while lines provided by the user, are preceded with ">". These symbols are not part of the program execution.
